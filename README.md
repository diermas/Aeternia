# Untitled-Deck-Builder

Our final year coursework for Games Development was a simulated games studio called CheddarCat. The entire class was a member of the studio, and we were all given the opportunity to pitch and then lead a game through development over the year.
I pitched an RPG deck-building game, and was lucky enough to be chosen as a successful product and given the go-ahead to lead a group on the game through the year.
As project lead, I was in charge of allocating work tasks to each member. I was also the main game designer in terms of card effects, character abilities and the basic enemy structure for the game.
I helped program some of the card gameplay features as well.
